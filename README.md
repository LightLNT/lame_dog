# Lame Dog: fault-tolerant Go2–SO-101 locomotion

An external Isaac Lab task package for velocity tracking with a Unitree Go2 carrying an SO-101 arm. The three
front-left leg motors produce zero effort; the leg and foot remain physical and can contact the ground. The policy
controls the other nine leg joints. The arm is part of the articulated model but is not a policy action.

For the exact environment, training, continuation, and checkpoint playback commands, see
[Reproducing the experiment](docs/REPRODUCING.md). The packaged USD composition layers, three small checkpoints, and
per-iteration training metrics are included, so no paths under the original author's home directory are needed.

The registered tasks are:

- `LameDog-Velocity-Flat-Go2So101` — the three-legged Go2–SO-101 experiment.
- `LameDog-Velocity-Flat-Go2So101-LowSpeed` — the historical low-speed training phase.

## Installation

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), then create the project environment. The default
environment uses the Newton backend and does not install Isaac Sim:

```bash
uv sync
```

This project's `pyproject.toml` uses editable relative paths to an Isaac Lab source checkout. Update
`[tool.uv.sources]` if either directory moves.

The project forwards every optional extra declared by the Isaac Lab package used to create it, including physics,
rendering, visualizer, RL, teleoperation, and development features. Inspect `pyproject.toml` for the complete list and
pass each required extra to `uv run`:

```bash
# Standalone OV PhysX
uv run --extra ovphysx isaaclab random_agent --task <TASK_NAME> physics=ovphysx

# Isaac Sim with PhysX and RTX rendering
uv run --extra isaacsim isaaclab random_agent --task <TASK_NAME> physics=isaacsim_physx

# Isaac Sim with the Rerun visualizer
uv run --extra isaacsim --extra rerun isaaclab random_agent --task <TASK_NAME> --viz rerun
```

The `all` extra forwards Isaac Lab's `all` selection. The `ov` extra installs both the `ovphysx` and `ovrtx` runtimes;
you can also select either independently. Commit `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` so collaborators use the same
environment.

## Run the tasks

Replace the placeholders below with a task listed above and a selected RL library.

```bash
# List this project's environments and their available presets
uv run isaaclab list_envs --show_presets

# Exercise an environment without a trained policy
uv run isaaclab zero_agent --task <TASK_NAME> --num_envs 16
uv run isaaclab random_agent --task <TASK_NAME> --num_envs 16

# Train and play
uv run isaaclab train --rl_library <RL_LIBRARY> --task <TASK_NAME>
uv run isaaclab play --rl_library <RL_LIBRARY> --task <TASK_NAME> --checkpoint latest

# Distributed training
uv run isaaclab train_multigpu --rl_library <RL_LIBRARY> --task <TASK_NAME> --num_gpus 2

# Benchmark startup, runtime, training, or play
uv run isaaclab benchmark runtime --task <TASK_NAME> --num_envs 16 --num_steps 1000
uv run isaaclab benchmark training --rl_library <RL_LIBRARY> --task <TASK_NAME> --max_iterations 10
```

Use `physics=<PRESET>` to select one of the presets shown by `isaaclab list_envs`.

## Project structure

Task families live in `src/lame_dog/tasks`. The velocity task is registered under
`tasks/velocity/config/go2_so101`; its robot configuration lives in `assets/go2_so101_cfg.py`.

## Project assets

The two project-owned USD composition layers are under `src/lame_dog/assets/data/robots`. They reference upstream
Go2 and SO-101 assets hosted by NVIDIA, which must be reachable on the first load. The asset module exposes a
stable path that works from an editable checkout and an installed wheel:

```python
from lame_dog.assets import LAME_DOG_ASSETS_DIR

robot_usd_path = LAME_DOG_ASSETS_DIR / "robots" / "go2_so101.usda"
```

Asset configuration lives in `lame_dog.assets`. The included layers and checkpoints are small enough for ordinary
Git; Git LFS is not required to clone this experiment. Check upstream asset terms before redistributing any
additional robot meshes or textures.

## Development

Run the registration test and code-quality checks through the project environment:

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

The test helpers under `source/isaaclab_tasks/test` in the Isaac Lab repository are not part of the installed
`isaaclab_tasks` package. Keep test fixtures in this project and use public Isaac Lab APIs. If you copy
`env_test_utils.py`, it becomes vendored code whose upstream changes you must track.

To configure VS Code or Cursor, run the `setup_python_env` task or invoke its command directly:

```bash
uv run isaaclab --editor
```

The setup command selects the active interpreter and writes a git-ignored `pyrightconfig.json`. The resulting
configuration inherits the project's checked-in Pyright settings and adds the Isaac Sim extensions, project `src` root,
and any Isaac Lab packages discovered in the active Python environment. This supports both Pylance in VS Code and
basedpyright in Cursor.

In VS Code, use Pylance and select the interpreter that ran the setup command. In Cursor, install the
[basedpyright extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=detachhead.basedpyright) instead of
Pylance, select the same interpreter, and reload the window. Both language servers read `pyrightconfig.json`.

When using the `isaacsim` extra, include it while generating the editor configuration so the command can discover the
Isaac Sim installation:

```bash
uv run --extra isaacsim isaaclab --editor
```

For an Isaac Sim binaries installation that is not available in the project environment, provide its path explicitly:

```bash
# Linux
uv run isaaclab --editor --isaac_path <isaac-sim-path>

# Windows
uv run isaaclab --editor --isaac_path <isaac-sim-path>
```

## Troubleshooting

If Pylance or basedpyright cannot resolve modules, confirm that the selected interpreter matches the one used to run the
setup command, then reload the editor window. To add a missing extension or reduce indexing memory, edit the `extraPaths`
array in the root `pyrightconfig.json`; remove simulator extension directories that the project does not use.
